## Step-by-Step Workflow

### Phase 0: Preparation (30 minutes)

**Before running any scripts:**

1. **Read the main plan:**
   ```bash
   less REFERENCE-REPOS-ANALYSIS-PLAN.md
   ```
   Focus on:
   - Tier 1 projects (most critical)
   - Analysis methodology
   - Expected outcomes

2. **Review the extraction script:**
   ```bash
   less extract-reference-structures.sh
   ```
   Understand what it will do before executing

3. **Verify tools installed:**
   ```bash
   # Required
   git --version
   
   # Highly recommended
   tree --version
   
   # Optional but helpful
   cloc --version
   ```
   
   Install missing tools:
   ```bash
   # Fedora
   sudo dnf install git tree cloc
   
   # Arch
   sudo pacman -S git tree cloc
   ```

4. **Create workspace:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures
   mkdir -p ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-analyses
   mkdir -p ~/fx-shell/docs/comparative-analysis
   ```

---

### Phase 1: Extraction (2-3 hours)

**Extract all repository structures:**

1. **Run the extraction script:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/fx-shell
   bash extract-reference-structures.sh
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Clone all Tier 1-3 repositories to `/tmp/fx-shell-analysis/`
   - Extract structures to `~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/`
   - Create analysis stubs in `~/fx-shell/docs/reference-analyses/`
   - Generate summary report

2. **Review the summary:**
   ```bash
   cat ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/EXTRACTION-SUMMARY.md
   ```

3. **Quick sanity check:**
   ```bash
   # List all extracted structures
   ls -lh ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/
   
   # Count total repos extracted
   ls -1 ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/*-L3.txt | wc -l
   
   # Should see 10 projects (Tier 1-3)
   ```

4. **Browse a few structures:**
   ```bash
   # Look at DankMaterialShell (most important)
   less ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/DankMaterialShell-L3.txt
   
   # Compare with Noctalia
   less ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/noctalia-shell-L3.txt
   
   # Check Waybar for Sway patterns
   less ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/Waybar-L3.txt
   ```

---

### Phase 2: Individual Analysis (Week 1)

**Deep dive into each project:**

#### Day 1-2: DankMaterialShell (Most Important!)

1. **Open the analysis stub:**
   ```bash
   $EDITOR ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-analyses/DankMaterialShell-ANALYSIS.md

   - Questions for further research

6. **Cross-reference with dgop:**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/fx-shell-analysis/dgop
   tree -L 2
   # Understand how DMS uses dgop
   ```

#### Day 3-4: Noctalia Shell

1. **Open analysis stub:**
   ```bash

   ```

2. **Focus on:**
   - CompositorService abstraction
   - Multi-compositor support patterns
   - Module organization
   - EventBus implementation
   - ServiceRegistry patterns
   - Configuration system

3. **Compare with DankMaterialShell:**
   ```bash
   # Side-by-side comparison
   diff -y \
     ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/DankMaterialShell-dirs.txt \
     ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/noctalia-shell-dirs.txt | less
   ```

4. **Document differences and similarities**

#### Day 5: Waybar (Sway IPC Patterns)

1. **Open analysis stub:**
   ```bash
   $EDITOR ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-analyses/Waybar-ANALYSIS.md
   ```

2. **Focus on (C++ code, but extract patterns):**
   - Sway IPC implementation
   - Event subscription
   - Workspace tracking
   - Window management
   - Module organization

3. **Study key files:**
   ```bash
   cd /tmp/fx-shell-analysis/Waybar
   find . -path "*/sway/*" -name "*.cpp" -o -name "*.hpp"
   
   # These are CRITICAL for fx-shell Sway integration
   ```

4. **Document how to adapt C++ patterns to QML/Qt**

#### Day 6-7: Remaining Tier 1-2 Projects

- Vantesh dotfiles (configuration patterns)
- Caelestia (build system)
- End-4 Dots (innovative widgets)

**Goal:** Complete all individual analysis stubs by end of Week 1

---

### Phase 3: Comparative Analysis (Week 2)

**Synthesize findings across all projects:**

1. **Open the comparison framework:**
   ```bash
   cp COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS-FRAMEWORK.md \
      ~/fx-shell/docs/comparative-analysis/COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS.md
   
   $EDITOR ~/fx-shell/docs/comparative-analysis/COMPARATIVE-ANALYSIS.md
   ```

2. **Fill in comparison matrices:**
   - Top-level organization
   - Module patterns
   - Service architecture
   - Configuration management
   - IPC/Event systems
   - Build systems
   - Testing strategies
   - Documentation

   **Use your individual analysis docs as source material**

3. **Identify patterns:**
   ```
   Pattern 1: Service Registry with Auto-Registration
   - Seen in: DankMaterialShell, Noctalia
   - Pros: Clean dependency injection, loose coupling
   - Cons: Requires registry infrastructure
   - Recommendation: ADOPT for fx-shell
   
   Pattern 2: Direct Module Imports
   - Seen in: Caelestia, Some parts of DMS
   - Pros: Simple, explicit dependencies
   - Cons: Tight coupling, hard to test
   - Recommendation: AVOID in favor of registry
   ```

4. **Document anti-patterns:**
   ```
   Anti-Pattern: Circular Dependencies
   - Seen in: [If found anywhere]
   - Problem: Makes testing impossible, unclear dependencies
   - Solution: Use event bus for cross-cutting concerns
   ```

5. **Create pattern catalog:**
   ```bash
   $EDITOR ~/fx-shell/docs/PATTERN-CATALOG.md
   ```
   
   Extract all identified patterns into reusable catalog:
   - Service patterns
   - Configuration patterns
   - IPC patterns
   - Module communication patterns
   - etc.

---

### Phase 4: Recommendations (Week 3)

**Translate analysis into actionable recommendations:**

1. **Create recommendations document:**
   ```bash
   $EDITOR ~/fx-shell/docs/ARCHITECTURE-RECOMMENDATIONS.md
   ```

2. **Structure the recommendations:**
   
   **Section 1: Current Assessment**
   - What's working well in current fx-shell structure
   - What needs improvement
   - Gaps to fill

   **Section 2: Recommended Changes**
   - Module reorganization (if needed)
   - New patterns to adopt
   - Anti-patterns to eliminate
   - Build system improvements
   - Testing strategy

   **Section 3: Code Extraction Plan**
   - High-priority components to extract from references
   - Adaptation strategies for each
   - Integration plan into fx-shell

   **Section 4: Implementation Phases**
   - Phase 1: Quick wins (1-2 weeks)
   - Phase 2: Major improvements (1 month)
   - Phase 3: Advanced features (2-3 months)

3. **Update the roadmap:**
   ```bash
   $EDITOR ~/fx-shell/docs/ROADMAP-UPDATE.md
   ```
   
   Based on your analysis, adjust the original roadmap:
   - Reorder priorities
   - Add newly discovered patterns
   - Update time estimates
   - Identify blocking dependencies

4. **Prioritize code extraction:**
   ```bash
   $EDITOR ~/fx-shell/docs/CODE-EXTRACTION-PRIORITIES.md
   ```
   
   List components to extract, in priority order:
   ```
   PRIORITY 1: SwayService IPC Handler (from Waybar patterns)
   - Lines: ~500-1000
   - Complexity: High
   - Dependencies: None
   - Target: modules/core/compositor/src/SwayIPC.qml
   - Effort: 3-5 days
   
   PRIORITY 2: Notification Widget (from DankMaterialShell)
   - Lines: ~200-300
   - Complexity: Medium

## Post-Analysis: Transition to Implementation

**You're now ready to start building!**

### Immediate Next Steps (Week 4)

1. **Begin highest-priority module:**
   Based on your CODE-EXTRACTION-PRIORITIES.md, start with Priority 1

2. **Follow the patterns you documented:**
   Use your PATTERN-CATALOG.md as reference

3. **Extract and adapt code:**
   Don't just copy - understand and adapt to fx-shell architecture

4. **Iterate and refine:**
   As you implement, patterns may evolve - that's OK!
   Update docs as you learn

### Ongoing Process

- **Continuous learning:** Keep analyzing new projects
- **Pattern refinement:** Update catalog as patterns prove themselves
- **Documentation:** Keep everything updated
- **Community:** Share findings, contribute back to reference projects

---

## Key Success Factors

### DO:
- ✅ Take time to understand before implementing
- ✅ Document everything you learn
- ✅ Look for patterns across multiple projects
- ✅ Adapt patterns to fit fx-shell, don't just copy
- ✅ Consider maintainability and future growth
- ✅ Focus on applicability to fx-shell's goals

### DON'T:
- ❌ Rush through analysis to get to coding
- ❌ Copy code without understanding it
- ❌ Ignore anti-patterns you find
- ❌ Skip the comparison phase
- ❌ Forget about the original fx-shell vision
- ❌ Try to adopt every pattern you see

---

## Quick Reference Commands

```bash
# View extracted structure
less ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/[project]-L3.txt

# Compare two structures
diff -y \
  ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/[project1]-dirs.txt \
  ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/[project2]-dirs.txt

# Edit analysis
$EDITOR ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-analyses/[project]-ANALYSIS.md

# Check file types
cat ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/[project]-filetypes.txt

# Count structures extracted
ls -1 ~/fx-shell/docs/reference-structures/*-L3.txt | wc -l

# Browse cloned repo
cd /tmp/fx-shell-analysis/[project]
tree -L 2
find . -name "*.qml" -type f

# Generate side-by-side diff
diff -y --width=200 file1 file2 | less
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: tree command not found
```bash
# Install tree
sudo dnf install tree      # Fedora
sudo pacman -S tree         # Arch
```

### Issue: cloc command not found
```bash
# Install cloc (optional but helpful)
sudo dnf install cloc       # Fedora
sudo pacman -S cloc         # Arch
```

### Issue: Can't clone a repository
```bash
# Check if repo URL is correct
git ls-remote [repo-url]

# Try shallow clone manually
git clone --depth 1 [repo-url] /tmp/test-clone
```

### Issue: Out of disk space
```bash
# Cloned repos can take 1-2 GB total
# Clean up after extraction:
rm -rf /tmp/fx-shell-analysis/

# You have the structure files, no need to keep clones
```

---

## Time Estimates

**Phase 0 (Prep):** 30 minutes  
**Phase 1 (Extraction):** 2-3 hours  
**Phase 2 (Individual Analysis):** 5-7 days  
**Phase 3 (Comparison):** 3-4 days  
**Phase 4 (Recommendations):** 2-3 days  
**Phase 5 (Review):** 1-2 days  

**Total:** ~3 weeks focused effort

**Can be compressed if needed, but quality suffers**

---

## Minimal Viable Analysis

**If you have less time, absolute minimum is:**

1. **Tier 1 Only:** Focus on DankMaterialShell + Noctalia + Waybar (1 week)
2. **Quick Comparison:** Basic pattern comparison (2 days)
3. **Top Priorities:** Document only high-priority patterns (1 day)
4. **Fast Recommendations:** Quick recommendations doc (1 day)

**Total Minimum:** ~2 weeks

**Trade-off:** Less comprehensive, might miss important patterns

---

## Final Thoughts

**Remember:** This analysis phase is an investment.

3 weeks of careful study will save you **months** of:
- Refactoring poorly structured code
- Fixing architectural mistakes
- Redesigning module boundaries
- Dealing with technical debt

**The goal isn't perfection** - it's informed decision-making.

You'll still make mistakes and need to adjust, but you'll make **better mistakes** - ones you can learn from quickly.

---

## You're Ready!

You have:
- ✅ Planning documents
- ✅ Extraction scripts
- ✅ Analysis frameworks
- ✅ This guide

**Next action:** Run the extraction script and start analyzing!

```bash
cd ~/fx-shell
bash extract-reference-structures.sh
```
