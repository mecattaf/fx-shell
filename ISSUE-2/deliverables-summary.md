---

## Key Principles to Remember

### During Analysis:

1. **Stay in planning mode** - No implementation yet!
2. **Document everything** - Future you will thank you
3. **Look for patterns** - Don't just catalog features
4. **Think critically** - Not everything is worth adopting
5. **Consider context** - What works for one project may not work for fx-shell
6. **Question assumptions** - Why did they do it this way?
7. **Focus on applicability** - How does this help fx-shell?

### Quality Over Speed:

- Thoroughness now saves refactoring later
- Understanding patterns is more important than speed
- Good documentation is an investment
- Careful analysis prevents costly mistakes

---

## Success Metrics

You'll know the analysis phase is successful when you can answer:

1. **What organizational pattern should fx-shell use?**
   - And why, based on evidence from multiple projects

2. **How should modules communicate?**
   - Service registry? Event bus? Direct imports? Why?

3. **What configuration approach fits best?**
   - JSON? QML? Split files? Why?

4. **Which code should we extract first?**
   - Priority list with rationale

5. **What should we definitely NOT do?**
   - Anti-patterns documented with reasoning

6. **How should Sway IPC be implemented?**
   - Specific patterns from Waybar, adapted for QML

7. **What are the next 3 modules to build?**
   - With clear implementation strategy for each

If you can answer these confidently with documented evidence, the analysis was successful!

## Support & Troubleshooting

### If Stuck:

1. **Re-read relevant sections** of the planning documents
2. **Check the troubleshooting section** in QUICK-START-GUIDE.md
3. **Review examples** in the templates
4. **Take a break** and come back with fresh perspective
5. **Ask for help** with specific questions

### Common Issues:

**"Too much information, overwhelmed"**
→ Start with just DankMaterialShell + Waybar (most critical)

**"Not sure if I'm analyzing correctly"**
→ Follow the templates exactly, fill in each section

**"Running out of time"**
→ Use the "Minimal Viable Analysis" approach in the quick start guide

**"Found conflicting patterns"**
→ Document the trade-offs, make a decision based on fx-shell's needs

**"Want to start coding"**
→ Resist! Good planning now = less refactoring later

## Final Notes

**What This Is:**
- A comprehensive planning framework
- A systematic analysis methodology
- Automation to save time
- Templates to ensure consistency
- A roadmap to guide you

**What This Isn't:**
- Implementation code
- A shortcut to skip analysis
- A guarantee of perfect decisions
- A substitute for critical thinking

**The Goal:**
Make informed architectural decisions based on proven patterns from successful projects, avoiding common pitfalls, and setting fx-shell up for long-term success.

---

## Closing Thoughts

You've completed Issue #1 (infrastructure) successfully. You have a solid foundation.

Now you're entering the analysis phase - arguably the most important phase of the entire project. The decisions you make here will affect fx-shell for years to come.

These documents give you everything you need to make those decisions well.

**Take your time. Be thorough. Document everything.**

The implementation phase will be much smoother because of the work you're about to do.

## Questions?

If you have questions about these deliverables or the analysis process:

1. Re-read the relevant document sections
2. Check the FAQ/troubleshooting sections
3. Review the examples provided
4. Ask specific questions with context
