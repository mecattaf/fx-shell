# fx-shell Consolidated References

**Purpose:** This document extracts unique reference materials not covered in the main specification (spec.md).

## External Projects for Module Development

### Scroll Window Manager Integration
**Source:** https://github.com/dawsers/gtkshell

**Action Item:** Identify scroll-specific widgets/modules that could be reimplemented in QuickShell, similar to how projects have compositor-specific modules (sway/hyprland/niri).

**Potential Contribution:** These patterns could be contributed back to the main QuickShell project.

## Noctalia-Specific Patterns Worth Preserving

### Reference Material Organization Strategy

Noctalia's approach to embedding reference implementations within modules is highly effective for LLM-driven development:

```
modules/[feature]/
├── src/                    # Main implementation
├── reference/              # Curated examples
│   ├── noctalia/          # Adapted from Noctalia
│   ├── hyprland-examples/ # Alternative implementations
│   ├── sway-native/       # Native patterns
│   └── quickshell-patterns/ # Cross-project examples
├── tests/
├── examples/
└── architecture.md
```

**Key Insight:** Each module becomes self-documenting with embedded reference implementations, eliminating extensive cross-project research during development.

### CompositorService Abstraction Pattern

Noctalia's multi-compositor support provides valuable patterns even though fx-shell is Sway-first:

**Abstraction Benefits:**
- Clean service interface independent of compositor specifics
- Simplified future expansion to other compositors
- Testable without actual compositor running
- Clear separation between UI and system integration

**Implementation Approach:**
```qml
// Abstract interface (compositor-agnostic)
QtObject {
    property var workspaces
    property int currentWorkspace
    property var windows
    
    function switchWorkspace(id) { /* implemented by backend */ }
    function moveWindow(windowId, workspaceId) { /* ... */ }
}

// Sway-specific implementation
SwayCompositorBackend {
    // i3-IPC specific implementation
}

// Future: HyprlandCompositorBackend, RiverCompositorBackend, etc.
```

## AGS Ecosystem Insights (Historical Context)

**Note:** fx-shell has pivoted to QuickShell, but AGS ecosystem research provides valuable context for understanding the broader Wayland shell landscape.

### Architectural Evolution Understanding

**AGS v3's Modular Approach:**
- **Astal:** Vala/C backend libraries (system integration)
- **Gnim:** JSX/reactive frontend (UI framework)
- **AGS CLI:** Scaffolding and tooling

**Lesson for fx-shell:** QuickShell's Qt/QML stack provides similar benefits:
- **Qt C++ backend:** Native performance (like Astal)
- **QML declarative UI:** Modern development experience (like Gnim)
- **QuickShell framework:** Wayland integration and tooling (like AGS CLI)

### Widget Ecosystem Analysis from AGS Projects

Certain AGS implementations demonstrated innovative features worth considering for QuickShell adaptation:

**matshell (AGS):**
- Adaptive layouts (desktop/laptop modes)
- Advanced theming system

**gleaming-glacier (AGS):**
- Polkit agent implementation patterns
- Authentication dialog design

**End-4 dots-hyprland (AGS + QuickShell):**
- AI plugin architecture
- Shortcut visualization widget

These represent proven UX patterns that could inspire QuickShell implementations.

## Fabric/Python Ecosystem Unique Features

### Ax-Shell & Tsumiki Innovations

**OCR Text Recognition (Tsumiki):**
- First implementation observed in desktop shell context
- Tesseract integration via Python
- Screen text extraction workflow

**Implementation Notes for QuickShell:**
- Could use QProcess to call tesseract CLI
- Or integrate via Qt plugins if performance-critical

**Pomodoro Timer Widget (Ax-Shell):**
- Timer service with notification integration
- Break interval management
- Productivity statistics

## Cross-Framework Widget Feature Matrix

This matrix shows unique features found in specific frameworks that might require special attention during QuickShell implementation:

| Feature | Framework | Unique Aspect | QuickShell Adaptation Strategy |
|---------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| OCR Tool | Fabric (Tsumiki) | Screen text extraction | QProcess + tesseract CLI |
| AI Plugin | QuickShell (End-4) | Local LLM integration | Already in QuickShell ecosystem |
| Polkit Agent | AGS (gleaming-glacier) | Authentication dialogs | Qt D-Bus + PolicyKit integration |
| Live Window Previews | QuickShell (End-4) | Wayland protocol | Native QuickShell capability |
| Advanced Gestures | AGS (various) | Touch device support | Qt gesture recognition |
| Voice Control | None (moonshot) | Accessibility feature | Qt + speech recognition lib |

## Development Workflow Insights

### From Fabric Projects

**Explicit Feature Roadmaps (Ax-Shell):**
- Public roadmap with clear priorities
- Community input on feature development
- Transparent development process

**Lesson:** fx-shell should maintain similar transparency with:
- Public issue tracking
- Feature request process
- Development milestone visibility

### From QuickShell Projects

**DankMaterialShell's dgop IPC Framework:**
- Internal IPC for modular communication
- Event-driven architecture
- Clean service boundaries

**Lesson:** While fx-shell uses different patterns, the principle of clean IPC between components remains valuable.

## Reference Implementation Priority Map

For LLM-driven development, these are the most valuable reference implementations to study:

**Tier 1 - Direct Code Adaptation:**
1. **DankMaterialShell** - Complete QuickShell widget implementations
2. **Noctalia** - Modular architecture and compositor abstraction
3. **Waybar** - Production-grade Sway IPC integration

**Tier 2 - Pattern Extraction:**
4. **Caelestia** - Build system and deployment

   - IoT integration patterns

5. **Voice Control for Desktop Shell**
   - Accessibility-focused implementation
   - Natural language command parsing
   - Hands-free desktop interaction

## Historical Context Notes

### Why QuickShell Over AGS v3?

**Decision Rationale:**
1. **Maturity:** Qt/QML is more mature than Gnim (experimental)
2. **Performance:** Native Qt rendering vs JavaScript
3. **Ecosystem:** Existing QuickShell projects demonstrate production viability
4. **Development Experience:** QML developer tooling is superior
5. **Complexity:** AGS v3 architectural changes increase migration cost

**AGS v3 Advantages (not applicable to fx-shell):**
- TypeScript type safety
- React-like JSX patterns
- Growing AGS community
- Unified GTK4 styling

### Compositor Choice: Sway

**Why Sway First:**
1. Stable i3-compatible IPC protocol
2. Large existing user base
3. Proven integration patterns (waybar, swaybar)
4. Personal familiarity and daily use

**Future Expansion Considerations:**
- Hyprland (most popular alternative, JSON IPC)
- River (Wayland-native, modern architecture)
- Niri (innovative scrollable columns)
